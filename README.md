## Usage

To include videojs-dash-hls-bitrate-switcher on your website or web application, use any of the following methods.

### `<script>` Tag

This is the simplest case. Get the script in whatever way you prefer and include the plugin _after_ you include [video.js][videojs], so that the `videojs` global is available.

```html
<script src="//path/to/video.min.js"></script>
<script src="//path/to/videojs-dash-hls-bitrate-switcher.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var player = videojs("my-video");

  player.dashHlsBitrateSwitcher();
</script>
```

### Browserify/CommonJS

When using with Browserify, install videojs-dash-hls-bitrate-switcher via npm and `require` the plugin as you would any other module.

```js
var videojs = require("video.js");

// The actual plugin function is exported by this module, but it is also
// attached to the `Player.prototype`; so, there is no need to assign it
// to a variable.
require("videojs-dash-hls-bitrate-switcher");

var player = videojs("my-video");

player.dashHlsBitrateSwitcher();
```

### RequireJS/AMD

When using with RequireJS (or another AMD library), get the script in whatever way you prefer and `require` the plugin as you normally would:

```js
require(["video.js", "videojs-dash-hls-bitrate-switcher"], function (videojs) {
  var player = videojs("my-video");

  player.dashHlsBitrateSwitcher();
});
```
